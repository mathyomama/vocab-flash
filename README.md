vocab-flash
===========


This repository is for a small project which will help me study for the GRE, hopefully.

My goal is to make a version for bash (because I like the way bash looks) and maybe an iphone app if I am that ambitious.

I want to essentially use a good list of words and grab information from a site like wiktionary (using their api). The information would be a good enough dictionary entry, especially the etymology which gives a good history lesson and makes the words stick more easily.
