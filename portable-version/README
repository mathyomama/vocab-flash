This is the version which will gather definitions from a wiktionary tab separated value (.tsv) file. I found this while looking for information about parsing wiktionary. It seems like this version will be faster and won't resort to online resources (en.wiktionary.org) during runtime for information thus making it portable. This version is limited becasue the tsv doesn't have as much information as the website. This version will only include the word, part-of-speech, and definition.
