/*This file demonstrates how the dictionary entries are organized. The file to be read by the application is a tab separated value file (.tsv). This means all the information is delimited by tabs and new lines. English precedes every word because they are the English version of the word. "toolserver.org/~enwikt/definitions/" provides both an all language and a just English list of entries. I decided to take the latter because it is simpler. The file displays multiple definitions of words by placing the next definition on the following line in the same format as the previous line. An example of this is below.
